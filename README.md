# Node-Notes
This is a simple command line notes app made with NODE. The app requires fs, lodash, and yargs. Inside the terminal the user can add, read, list, and delete notes. All of the changes and updates are saved to a JSON file. The yargs package is used to parse the users command line arguments to make the app function smoothly and set requirements for each command line input the user enters.
